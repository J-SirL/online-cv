career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Linux System Administrator/DevOps and Automation engineer who loves to Automate, 
      Virtualize and solve complex problems. First and foremost I love Automation. 
      Ever since my first automatization of computer installations back in the 90:s. 

      The last few years I have been using ansible, python , vmware, xenserver, AWS, 
      Digital Ocean and private/hybrid cloud solutions to automate system infrastructure 
      to solve organisational needs. 
      I believe that most things can and should be automated to free time for the organisation 
      to focus on operational growth/new projects.
